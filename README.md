# Track My Sleep App

The development of the Track My Sleep app, as part of the "Developing Android Apps with Kotlin" course at Udacity, encompassed the integration of fundamental Android concepts.

Utilizing Room Database facilitated efficient storage and retrieval of sleep data, while Multithreading and Coroutines ensured seamless asynchronous operations.

RecyclerView, enhanced with Adapter, View Holders, and DiffUtil, enabled dynamic and optimized display of sleep records.

Data Binding streamlined UI updates by directly linking UI components to data properties.

Finally, implementing RecyclerView with GridLayout provided an aesthetically pleasing grid layout for visualizing sleep data.

## Overview

The app functions as follows:

1. The user clicks on "Start" to begin recording their sleep.
2. Upon completion, they click on "Stop" and are redirected to a screen where they can select the quality of their sleep on a scale from 0 to 5.
3. The results are displayed in a RecyclerView with a grid layout.
4. By clicking on any item in the RecyclerView (representing a night of sleep), the user is directed to a details screen showing the duration of sleep, its quality, and the day of the week it occurred.
5. Additionally, the Track My Sleep app allows users to clear all records by clicking "Clear," thereby deleting all sleep entries from the database.
